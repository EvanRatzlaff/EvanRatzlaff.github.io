All I can really say about this section analogously , is that it was like learning formal Japanese on how to ask where things

are in a room and then being tested on having a casual, informal conversation with someone on a train where they asked 

you how you liked the weather but the only thing you could reply with is: document.getElementById('bathroom').



Fortunately, I am a positive person and feel that I actually did learn more than I realize. I have nearly(keyword, nearly)  everything working in my project. What I seem to struggle with is understanding the returning of my fetched information. right now I am displaying the ID of the parent rather than the name. Simple, yet confusing for me, maybe it's from the lack of sleep, or focusing too strongly in the wrong area of my directories, or just that I haven't taken a break, but I know once I have submitted this project it will click even more than it did before like it always does.

I loved the challenge, and find it encouraging to get over these minor bumps in the road.
