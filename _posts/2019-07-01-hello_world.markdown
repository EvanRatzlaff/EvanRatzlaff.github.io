Good afternoon! It's a bright and sunny 1pm here in Florida. My name is Evan and I am your blog host for this blog post, coming to you live(at the time) from deep within the valley of the shadow of the mouse.

Our focus today will be on time. It is an item that is of the essence, a ruling force that we never seem to have enough  of, it is spent wisely and wasted in the same moment. 

For me, I feel that it is necessary to devote specific moments to fully immerse myself in whatever it is that I am doing in order to complete the task. 

This is not always the case when learning to code. 

What I have found to be helpful when I get stuck on a problem is to take a break and let my mind regenerate so that I can approach the situation with "new eyes". 

I started my journey into coding because I was looking to change careers and find something more lucrative and stable in my life. 

What I've discovered on this journey is that you not only have to take a break, but also make sure that you are scheduled and manage your time well. 

What I like about taking a step in the direction of this career change is that I feel rejuvenated in a sense that I haven't felt since I was in college. It is the joy of learning that brings me satisfaction that I don't feel like I can find anywhere else. 

For now that's all I have for you. I hope this helped to give some insight and a better understanding of why I've chosen to take this leap of faith.
