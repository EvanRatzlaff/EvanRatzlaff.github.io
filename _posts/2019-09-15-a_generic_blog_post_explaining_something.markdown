Wow, so we are now at our rails final project. I feel like I have learned more than I can actually comprehend, and it makes me proud to think about it. I'm also very aware that I need to take care of a lot of cloudy areas in my understanding of what has come to be referred to as, "The magic of rails".

On a more serious note, I really do feel like with each project I gain a newer level of understanding and appreciation for those who have made it to this point before me without giving up. 


This  project was just like the last, an in-depth learning experience. 

What I feel like that stuck a little better with me in this project than the last was the understanding of how a web page should flow for a user. 

The areas that I feel I need to study would be the routing for user submitted data. 
My  users are able to like another user's joke but they can not unlike the joke without the code breaking. 

I also need to work on my understanding of what data is displayed in a particular view because right now my user's can only see the rooms in which they have performed a joke.

These are the issues I will be looking to fix in my video walkthrough. 

For anyone reading this who is on the fence about whether or not to continure along this journey, my advice is this:

Find comfort in the errors you make. Your ambition to see the success will only grow stronger with the persitence you apply.
