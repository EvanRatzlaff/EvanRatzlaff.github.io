## Good morning all!

This marks my fourth week of my coding journey and my second blog post. This is actually supposed to be our break week, but I chose to take this week to get caught up and review what I've learned so far. I find the pace of this program to be a worthy challenge that I enjoy; even when it frustrates me and makes me rethink my existence...
It's like I get to learn a new skill and discover more about myself along the way. So for this post, let's take the metaphorical approach to understanding the programming experience in relation to understanding life. Which kind of means that we may not reach any specific point or truth, rather we will only point towards what we can gather as truthy or falsey. 

### Becoming a developer doesn't happen overnight. 

I like to think about Society as one big first class object. Within this class we call Society, we have several different realms of thought and behavior, much like the instance methods contained within a class. As an individual becomes conscious of it's roles in society, certain behaviors and thoughts are initialized upon the individual. These are the societal norms that we learn from our parents. Society today however, is not the same as it was ten years ago. 

### The deletion of discomfort

Society has created a loop where each new person that becomes a part of the object is given this ideology that faster is better. That we must receive gratification from what we do within seconds, or minutes. We have removed such a multitude of discomfort from our day to day lives that most of us become frustrated if it takes any significant amount of time to achieve a noteworthy level of success. If we don't see the success on a near instant scale, we assume that we are "wasting" our time.  I think that by enrolling in this program I have begun the process of unsubscribing to that style of thought. 

I just finished watching a coding lecture given by Avi Flombaum while writing this post and one specific thing he said that stuck out to me was about the removal of discomfort. Essentially what he explained was that if we are not willing to deal with some discomfort, then we are less likely to try something new. 

I think that there is this idea around trying something new that connotes a feeling of only excitement and joy, but the reality is more relative to a feeling of stress and discomfort when it comes to engaging with something foreign. It is when we begin to grow accustomed to understanding the fundamentals of this new idea that we begin to enjoy those new strange interactions. 

### Find what feels good in a strange environment

I have always been someone who thoroughly enjoys learning something new. Which is a nice way to say that I am someone who enjoys being confused. With coding however, there is a looming feeling that I am not retaining anything that I am learning. However, after taking time to review how far I've come I realize that I know a lot more than I realize. 

I love who I am, and I love what I am discovering. All I can do now is look forward to what comes next on the journey.
