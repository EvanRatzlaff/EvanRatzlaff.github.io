Good afternoon everyone, today's blog post will be focused around the utilization of speaking about our code in a more technical format. 

What I find most difficult about talking in a more technical fashion is the issue of knowing when to describe the action of what a specific line of code is actually doing in a complex fashion or in a more simplistic way. 

For example, when we explain the basics, we need to focus on conceptualization of a specific term. We need to make sure we choose our words carefully in order to properly convey our understanding. 

There is a big difference between:

IF statements and "if loops". One is real, the other....well, isn't.
