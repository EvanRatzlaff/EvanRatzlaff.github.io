## Bringing it all together


### So far, this journey has been very interesting, I am constantly in a state of feeling like I am learning nothing but as soon as I begin to conceptualize what it is that I want to produce, the knowledge begins to flow. This project taught me a lot about what I took for granted as a user and what comes in to play for the flow of a website.

### My idea for this project was a lot larger than I think I was capable of taking on at this point of the course, but after establishing the initial foundation, I think I will be able to add the changes I would like in a very short time.
